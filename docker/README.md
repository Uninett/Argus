# Docker production image of Argus

Whereas the top-level Dockerfile is development-oriented, this directory
contains definitions to build a production-oriented Docker image of the Argus
API backend component.

To build this image, the build context needs to be that of the git repository
root. Something like this would work (when the current working directory is
here):

```shell
docker build -t argus -f Dockerfile ..
```

Or, from the top level directory:

```shell
docker build -t argus -f docker/Dockerfile .
```

## Configuration of the running container

This image runs with default production settings, with a few tweaks from
[dockersettings.py](dockersettings.py). This means that the most useful
settings can be overriden through the use of environment variables exported to
the container.  Consult the documentation section on [site-specific
settings](http://argus-server.rtfd.io/en/latest/site-specific-settings.html).

## Limitations

This is not a complete Argus environment.  This image only defines the backend
API server component. It still depends on a PostgreSQL to be
functional. Also, the Argus front-end component is needed to have a functional
user interface against the API server.

For a full production environment example, take a look at
