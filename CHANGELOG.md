# Changes
This file documents all changes to Argus. This file is primarily meant to be
read by developers.

## [Unreleased]

## Next up: [1.13.0]

Works with argus-frontend 1.11 and newer.

### Added
- Lint for critical problems before testing in Github CI, to speed things up
- Added config-file for building docs at readthedocs
- Add inline destinations to user edit page in admin
- Add management command for listing filters
- Add management command for bulk acting on incidents matching a given filter

### Fixed
- Raise validation error on posting incident with tags without tag key

### Changed
- Update Django patch versions and various dependencies
- Drop support for Python 3.7. Github's CI/CD was sufficiently different from
  testing on local (different setuptools-version used maybe?) that we had
  a "fun" goose chase finding and upgrading the sub-dependency that broke the
  build.
- Remove all remaining uses of `Filter.filter_string`, replace with
  Filter.filter, in preparation of removing the actual `filter_string` field
  from the database.

  The API v1 still accepts `filter_string` but it is optional. It will prefer
  the data in `filter`. v2 ignores the presence or absence of `filter_string`
  entirely.

## [1.12.4] - 2023-09-04

### Changed
- Ensure that the start event is created *after* the incident has its tags so
  that notification filters with tags trigger correctly. The signal that
  creates the first event is gone, but the signal that triggers on creation of
  the first event is not, that will have to wait until we utilize a queue.

## [1.12.3] - 2023-08-31

### Changed
- Change what is logged on notification sending in order to ease solving
  problems in production

## [1.12.2] - 2023-06-27

### Fixed
- When sending a notification in production a typo lead to an exception that
  prevented sending the notification but was otherwise hidden from the end
  user.

## [1.12.1] - 2023-05-04

### Fixed
- Typo in code (that could have been found by flake8) lead to acks not working
  when notifications are turned on

## [1.12.0] - 2023-05-03

### Added
- More tests. Lots.
- Add docs for how to write a notification plugin
- Add a new command "stresstest", for stress-testing the API
- Start a process for revealing to the frontend which media plugins are
  actually installed
- Log a warning if a medium in the Media-table does not have a plugin installed
- Mention cookiecutter-template for tickets in the ticket docs
- Support running on Django 4.2
- Documented how to use email to send notifications to Slack
- Make the auth-method endpoint also show that username/password is supported
- In ticket-automation, show which fields were configured but not found in the
  generated ticket

### Fixed
- Lots of formatting-bugaboos in the docs
- Allow updating of a timeslot with an empty time recurrence list, which
  results in all time recurrences to be removed from the timeslot

### Changed
- Optimize and refactor bulk api operations
- Change how media plugins are accessed in order to avoid/control some exceptions
- Start the process of getting rid of `Filter.filter_string` by ensuring the
  info in `filter_string` is also in `Filter.filter`
- Correct some api examples in docs
- Only fork a new process to send notifications if there are any notifications
  to send
- Upgrade lots of dependencies
- Support explicit timestamp in `Incident.set_open/set_closed`
- Change how parameter names to SerializerMethodFields are set up
- Improved ticket docs
- Fixed typos
- Simplify generation of frozen dependency list: trust pyproject.toml

## [1.11.1] - 2023-02-16

### Added
- Coverage of the notificationprofile app was improved with several new tests

### Fixed
- CORS-headers do not want explicit port numbers if the ports are the default
  for their type, that is: 80 for http or 443 for https. This lead to CORS not
  working if there was an explicit port in the `ARGUS_FRONTEND_URL` setting,
  which used to generate a CORS entry for the frontend. Such port numbers are
  now stripped when generating the CORS header.

## [1.11.0] - 2023-02-02

With this version, the API for bulk changes of incidents and sending of
notifications to new and interesting destinations via destination plugins has
been frozen, and should be ready for use, completing what was started in 1.10.

## Added
- Add default HTML template for autocreated tickets
- Also include frontend-url to incident in incident-serializer
- Output XML test-reports and set up github actions for it

### Fixed
- Fix API for adding events in bulk, with tests
- Fix API for bulk acking, with tests

### Changed
- Improved OpenAPI by adding some more docstrings
- Updated version of github-actions actions
- Use better exceptions for ticket plugins
- Change how/where change-events are created
- Move tests for included destinations to individual files

## [1.10.2] - 2022-12-13
