<!-- towncrier release notes start -->

## [1.19.2] - 2024-05-28

### Added

- There is now a commented line in `argus.site.urls.urlpatterns` that if
  uncommented will allow logging into the API with username/password. This
  allows the use of the DRF HTML api to change records. This partially works
  with django-debug-toolbar and should ease some debugging sessions.

### Changed

- Optimized PUT/PATCH of incidents in API v2. Mainly by no longer replacing
  `Incident.search_text` on every Incident save, thereby avoiding looking up
  all events for that incident. The old behavior was fine when there was only
  a handful of events per incident but we can no longer assume that.

## [1.19.1] - 2024-05-16

### Fixed

- Fixed bug preventing naive printing of TimeRecurrences, triggering
  a traceback

## [1.19.0] - 2024-05-15

*Backwards-incompatible change*: Because it is now possible to filter on
multiple event types instead of just one, both API V1 and API V2 has changed
its schema for Filter.filter. See NOTES.md for details.

### Removed

- Removed `"event_type"` from the V1 Filter API, it should only have been
  available in V2 (since it was new) and it has never been in use by the
  frontend. ([#699](https://github.com/Uninett/Argus/issues/699))

### Added

- Add filtering of events by a list of event types
  ([#699](https://github.com/Uninett/Argus/issues/699))
- Add howto about how to set up and test federated login, using GitHub as an
  example. ([#803](https://github.com/Uninett/Argus/issues/803))
- Extend the usefulness of `OVERRIDE_APPS` and `EXTRA_APPS` by adding support
  for Django template engine context processors. Any context processors are
  added to the end of the list.
  ([#810](https://github.com/Uninett/Argus/issues/810))

### Changed

- Change how the description of a change event is formatted so that it is
  always consistent (not to mention DRY).
  ([#809](https://github.com/Uninett/Argus/issues/809))


## [1.18.0] - 2024-05-07


### Added

- New in the API: Allow sources to delete their own incidents, as well as allow
  superusers to delete any incident.
  ([#804](https://github.com/Uninett/Argus/issues/804))

### Changed

- Allow replacing Incident.metadata with another json blob via API, no
  questions asked, nothing to see here.
  ([#807](https://github.com/Uninett/Argus/issues/807))


## [1.17.0] - 2024-05-03


### Added

- Add a possibility to filter incidents by start time in incident admin list
  ([#739](https://github.com/Uninett/Argus/issues/739))
- Added an optional JSONField "metadata" to incident. This can be used for any
  additional info the glue-service would like to store on the incident that
  needs more structure than tags. The field has been added to the V2
  IncidentSerializer but we do not plan to expose it in the frontend.
- Added documentation on how to safely test notifications.
- Added simple support for pluggable django-apps. The setting `OVERRIDING_APPS`
  is loaded first in `INSTALLED_APPS` and `urls.py`, and can override templates
  and views. The setting `EXTRA_APPS` is safer, it is loaded last in
  `INSTALLED_APPS` and `urls.py` and can therefore only add additional
  templates and views.

### Changed

- When editing a notification profile in the admin UI, only the profile owner's
  own filters are now listed as available for selection.
  ([#735](https://github.com/Uninett/Argus/issues/735))
- Linked up the second column in the admin incident list to the details view in
  addition to the default first column because the first column is currently an
  optional field. If the field has no value there can also not be a link.
- Update the release checklist in `docs/` to current practices and turn it into
  a howto.

### Fixed

- Show fully qualified details URL in emails
  ([#744](https://github.com/Uninett/Argus/issues/744))
- Fix internal server error in timeslot admin due to removed method
  ([#797](https://github.com/Uninett/Argus/issues/797))


## [1.16.0] - 2024-04-23

### Added

- Added development dependency on django-debug-toolbar to make it easy to use.
- Adds more capability to the stresstest command, including incident creation
  verification, bulk ACKing and timeout configuration.
  ([#641](https://github.com/Uninett/Argus/issues/641))
- Add possibility to set fields when creating fake incidents in Django admin
  ([#669](https://github.com/Uninett/Argus/issues/669))
- Show user and filter by user in notification profile admin
  ([#734](https://github.com/Uninett/Argus/issues/734))
- Add cli command to toggle notification profile activation
  ([#747](https://github.com/Uninett/Argus/issues/747))
- Add admin action to change activation of profiles
  ([#748](https://github.com/Uninett/Argus/issues/748))
- Add API documentation for GET responses
  ([#752](https://github.com/Uninett/Argus/issues/752))
- Added an informational page on /, with favicon, in order to cut down on some
  common 404 log messages and set up the static files system properly.

### Changed

- Switched official Docker image to serve using gunicorn+uvicorn
  ([#766](https://github.com/Uninett/Argus/issues/766))
- Changed how tristates (open, acked, stateful) are logged in order to improve
  debuggability.
- Return False and log if sms-to-email has trouble with the email server.
- To improve debugability: Change how sending notifications are logged so that
  there's a log both when sending succeds and when it fails.

### Fixed

- Changed references to docs for Django 4.2
  ([#746](https://github.com/Uninett/Argus/issues/746))
- Do not allow used destinations to be deleted
  ([#753](https://github.com/Uninett/Argus/issues/753))
- Fix typo in admin that prevented sorting on incident id


## [1.15.0] - 2024-04-10

Due to the removal of the django-multiselectfield dependency it is vitally
important to upgrade to *this* version *after* correctly having upgraded to
1.14.3 (the previous version).

Be sure to migrate the database:

```console
$ python manage.py migrate
```

This version supports Django 4.2 and newer.

### Changed

- Drop all support for Django 3.2. No version-specific requirements for 3.2 are
  included anymore, and we no longer test on 3.2.

### Removed

- Remove django-multiselectfield dependency ([#707](https://github.com/Uninett/Argus/issues/707))

## [1.14.3] - 2024-04-09

This release changes the database in order to get rid of a dead dependency,
make sure to run migrations.

This version can run on Django 5.0 if necessary. Install the dependencies in
`requirements-django50.txt` if so.

This is the last version that supports Django 3.2.

### Added

- Add filtering of incident list by notificationprofile

  This returns all incidents that are included in filters that are connected to
  that notificationprofile
- Added support for running and testing on Django 5.0

### Changed

- Change TimeRecurrence.days from MultiSelectField to ArrayField
  ([#707](https://github.com/Uninett/Argus/issues/707))
- Updated lots of depenendcies in order to run on Django 5.0

## [1.14.2] - 2024-02-15

This version can run on Django 4.2. In production, ensure that the list of
entries in `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` are absolute urls, all starting with
`https://`.

### Added

- Add filtering of incident list by filter

  This returns all incidents that are included in the filter
  ([#244](https://github.com/Uninett/Argus/issues/244))
- Allow running and testing on Python 3.12
- Added towncrier to automatically produce changelog
- Add two development dependencies

  While `tox` doesn't need to be in the venv, it DOES currently need to be less
  than version 4.

  `build` is useful for debugging pip errors and pip-compile trouble.
  Whenever pip-compile (via `tox -e upgrade-deps` for instance) fails with

  ```
  Backend subprocess exited when trying to invoke get_requires_for_build_wheel
  Failed to parse /PATH/pyproject.toml
  ```

  run `python -m build -w` to see what `build` is actually complaining about.

  See also https://github.com/pypa/build/issues/553
- Add the "admin_url" field to the user serializer. This is so that the
  frontend can show a link to the Django admin.
- Added the possibility to filter incident by a given list of ids

### Fixed

- Fixed posting/updating notification profiles without name

### Changed

- Updated a lot of (sub)dependencies to allow running on newer pythons and
  newer Djangos, and to quiet dependency bots

## [1.14.1 - 2023-12-05]

### Changed

- Restructured documentation about integrations

## [1.14.0] - 2023-01-03

Incomplete changelog.

Due to a change in the signature of `NotificationPlugin.send()`, 3rd party
plugins will need to mark better which versions of argus-server they work with
in their dependencies-list. The old-style plugins work on 1.9-1.13.

### Added
- Add the "installed" field to the media serializer. This is so that the
  frontend can detect media used that is no longer installed on the backend.

### Fixed
- Ensure the right notifications go to the right destinations when sending many
  of each.

### Changed
- Change the signature of the notification-plugin `send`-method to avoid
  passing in the database
- Log profile owners name when checking profiles
- Constrain subdependencies in a better way
- Send one email per email-address so as to not leak who else gets that email.
- Remove the `Filter.filter_string`-field from the database. We're not using it
  anymore and shouldn't ever use it by accident either.

## [1.13.0] - 2023-09-19

Works with argus-frontend 1.11 and newer.

### Added
- Lint for critical problems before testing in Github CI, to speed things up
- Added config-file for building docs at readthedocs
- Add inline destinations to user edit page in admin
- Add management command for listing filters
- Add management command for bulk acting on incidents matching a given filter

### Fixed
- Raise validation error on posting incident with tags without tag key

### Changed
- Update Django patch versions and various dependencies
- Drop support for Python 3.7. Github's CI/CD was sufficiently different from
  testing on local (different setuptools-version used maybe?) that we had
  a "fun" goose chase finding and upgrading the sub-dependency that broke the
  build.
- Remove all remaining uses of `Filter.filter_string`, replace with
  Filter.filter, in preparation of removing the actual `filter_string` field
  from the database.

  The API v1 still accepts `filter_string` but it is optional. It will prefer
  the data in `filter`. v2 ignores the presence or absence of `filter_string`
  entirely.

## [1.12.4] - 2023-09-04

### Changed
- Ensure that the start event is created *after* the incident has its tags so
  that notification filters with tags trigger correctly. The signal that
  creates the first event is gone, but the signal that triggers on creation of
  the first event is not, that will have to wait until we utilize a queue.

## [1.12.3] - 2023-08-31

### Changed
- Change what is logged on notification sending in order to ease solving
  problems in production

## [1.12.2] - 2023-06-27

### Fixed
- When sending a notification in production a typo lead to an exception that
  prevented sending the notification but was otherwise hidden from the end
  user.

## [1.12.1] - 2023-05-04

### Fixed
- Typo in code (that could have been found by flake8) lead to acks not working
  when notifications are turned on

## [1.12.0] - 2023-05-03

### Added
- More tests. Lots.
- Add docs for how to write a notification plugin

- In ticket-automation, show which fields were configured but not found in the
  generated ticket

### Fixed
- Lots of formatting-bugaboos in the docs
- Allow updating of a timeslot with an empty time recurrence list, which
  results in all time recurrences to be removed from the timeslot

### Changed
- Optimize and refactor bulk api operations
- Change how media plugins are accessed in order to avoid/control some exceptions
- Start the process of getting rid of `Filter.filter_string` by ensuring the
  info in `filter_string` is also in `Filter.filter`
- Correct some api examples in docs
- Only fork a new process to send notifications if there are any notifications
  to send
- Upgrade lots of dependencies

## [1.11.1] - 2023-02-16

### Added
- Coverage of the notificationprofile app was improved with several new tests

### Fixed
- CORS-headers do not want explicit port numbers if the ports are the default
  for their type, that is: 80 for http or 443 for https. This lead to CORS not
  working if there was an explicit port in the `ARGUS_FRONTEND_URL` setting,
  which used to generate a CORS entry for the frontend. Such port numbers are
  now stripped when generating the CORS header.

## [1.11.0] - 2023-02-02

With this version, the API for bulk changes of incidents and sending of
notifications to new and interesting destinations via destination plugins has
been frozen, and should be ready for use, completing what was started in 1.10.

## Added
