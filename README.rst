===================
argus-HTMx-frontend
===================

Experimental frontend for `argus-server`_ as a django app.

Will possibly cease to exist as a separate app if the experiment is deemed
successful.

See `argus-server`_ for more about argus.

Imports `django-htmx`_. See the `documentation for django-htmx`_
for details.

How to play
===========

Install
-------

To make sure you do not accidentally work on an old argus-server, do the following:

1. Use/make a venv, for instance: create a new one with ``python -m venv argus-htmx``
2. Check out argus-server code
3. Install argus-server dynamically into the venv: ``pip install -e .``
4. Check out this repo
5. Install this app dynamically into the venv: ``pip install -e .``

It is now safe to remove argus-server from the venv if you feel like it.

Configure
---------

Do this in your workdir, which could be the checked out `argus-server`_ repo.

Django-style
~~~~~~~~~~~~

In your local settings that star-imports from an `argus-server`_ settings file::

    INSTALLED_APPS += [
        "django_htmx",
        "argus_htmx",
    ]
    ROOT_URLCONF = "urls.py"
    MIDDLEWARE += ["django_htmx.middleware.HtmxMiddleware"]

In the same file, add a copy of the entirety of ``TEMPLATES``. Choose one of
the functions in ``argus_htmx.context_processors``. In the entry for
``django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates``, append the full dotted
path to the end of the ``context_processors`` list.

Next to ``localsettings.py`` create an ``urls.py`` containing::

   from argus.site.urls import urlpatterns

   urlpatterns += [
       path("", include("argus_htmx.urls")
   ]

With EXTRA_APPS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Choose one of the functions in ``argus_htmx.context_processors``, exemplified
by "theme_via_GET" below.

In your environment variables::

    ARGUS_EXTRA_APPS = '[{"app_name": "django_htmx"}, {"app_name": "argus_htmx", "urls": {"path": "", "urlpatterns_module": "argus_htmx.urls"}, "context_processors": ["argus_htmx.context_processor.theme_via_GET"]}]'

In your local settings that star-imports from an `argus-server`_ settings file::

    MIDDLEWARE += ["django_htmx.middleware.HtmxMiddleware"]

Update
------

On every new version, reinstall the dependencies since there might be new ones.

Themes
------

To try out class-less themes use the context processor
``argus_htmx.context_processor.theme_via_session`` instead of
``argus_htmx.context_processor.theme_via_GET``.

There are plenty of themes copied from `CSS Bed`_ to play with. Your own themes
can be added by copying one css-file per theme to the static path ``themes/``,
either in an app or in a directory mentioned in ``STATICFILES_DIRS``.

Icons, pictures, etc. used by the theme MUST be in a subdirectory named the
same as the theme (minus the ".css") in the same directory as the theme so
update the paths accordingly. See the included theme "default.css".


UI Settings
-----------

Incident table column customization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can customize which columns are shown in the incidents listing table by overriding the
``INCIDENT_TABLE_COLUMNS`` setting. This setting takes a list of ``str`` or
``argus_htmx.incidents.customization.IncidentTableColumn`` instances. when given a ``str``, this
key must be available in the ``argus_htmx.incidents.customization.BUILTIN_COLUMNS`` dictionary. For
example::

    from argus_htmx.incidents.customization import BUILTIN_COLUMNS, IncidentTableColumn

    INCIDENT_TABLE_COLUMNS = [
        "id",
        "start_time",
        BUILTIN_COLUMNS["description"], # equivalent to just "description"
        IncidentTableColumn( # a new column definition
            name="name",
            label="Custom"
            cell_template="/path/to/template.html"
            context={
                "additional": "value"
            }
        ),

    ]

For inbuilt support for other types of columns see the howtos in `the local docs <docs/howtos/>`_.
