# Release Notes

This file documents changes to Argus that are relevant for operations and
end-users.

## [1.19.2] - 2024-05-28

Optimization of API Incident PUT/PATCH.

## [1.19.1] - 2024-05-16

Tiny bugfix-release, nothing to see here.

## [1.19.0] - 2024-05-15

Remember to migrate!

*Backwards-incompatible change*: Because it is now possible to filter on
multiple event types instead of just one, both API V1 and API V2 has changed
its schema for Filter.filter.

* The key `"event_type"` is gone from V1. It never should have been there in
  the first place since it's new functionality.
* The key `"event_type"` has been *replaced* with a new key `"event_types"` in
  V2. Where `"event_type"` was a single string, `"event_types"` is a list of
  strings.

Luckily, the frontend at https://github.com/Uninett/argus-frontend never added
support for this feature.

Behavior does not change as the key not being set (or set to None/empty list)
will ignore the key when sending notifications.

Existing instances of `"event_type"` in the database is automatically changed
to `"event_types"` iff `"event_type"` was not falsey. Reversing the migration
will set `"event_type"` to the first string in `"event_types"` hence might lose
data: *don't reverse the migration in production!*

## [1.18.0] - 2024-05-07

There's a new API endpoint allowing the deletion of an existing incident and
its events. The new setting `INDELIBLE_INCIDENTS` controls this, the backwards
compatible setting is `True`. Toggle to `False` to allow deletion. The plan
forward is to limit deletion according to some rule we haven't decided on:

* limit it to "new" incidents, for an unfinished definition of "new"
* have an (optional) flag on incident controllable by the source
* so.. many.. ideas, hence, running code now, hard decisions later.

Smaller change: the data in Incident.metadata can now be replaced with HTTP
PATCH/PUT, in line with `ticket_url`, `details_url` and `level`.

## [1.17.0] - 2024-05-03

This release marks the start of The Great HTMx Experiment and a cooperation
with Geant.

Incidents have a gotten a new field so remember to run migrations.

There's a new "How To"-section in the docs, we expect it to grow rapidly.

There's lots of quality of life improvements in the admin.

There's a new way to add additional django apps to your own instance of
argus-server. Currently this is only via two new environment variables, see the
settings-documentation.

## [1.16.0] - 2024-04-23

The official docker image has been changed so if you use it in production have
a peak first.

The stresstest command is now a lot more useful: it is handy for even more
lazily creating a lot of fake incidents in the database where you don't care
about he contents. Just remember to turn off sending of notifications first!
You can turn it of or on for specific profiles with a new cli command:
`toggle_profile_activation`. It is now also easier to toggle, activate and
deactivate profiles in the admin. Have a look.

`django-debug-toolbar` has been added as a dev dependency but it is not in use
in the included dev settings yet.

## [1.15.0] - 2024-04-10

This release finishes the process started in 1.14.3. Make sure to run
the migrations in 1.14.3 before you run the migrations included here!

Furthermore, Django 3.2 is no longer supported so upgrade, upgrade!

## [1.14.3] - 2024-04-09

This release changes the database in order to get rid of a dead dependency,
make sure to run migrations:

```console
$ python manage.py migrate
```

This version can run on Django 5.0 if necessary. Install the dependencies in
`requirements-django50.txt` if so.

## [1.14.2] - 2024-02-15

This version can run on Django 4.2. In production, ensure that the list of
entries in `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` are absolute urls, all starting with
`https://`.

The CHANGELOG is now maintained by `towncrier`.

The frozen requirements-files have been updated with new versions, please
upgrade which versions are used in production accordingly with
`pip install -r requirements-djangoVERSION.txt` where VERSION is either `32`for
Django 3.2 or `42` for Django 4.2.

## [1.14.1 - 2023-12-05]

### Changed

- Restructured documentation about integrations

## [1.14.0] - 2023-01-03

Due to a change in the signature of `NotificationPlugin.send()`, 3rd party
plugins will need to mark better which versions of argus-server they work with
in their dependencies-list. The old-style plugins work on 1.9-1.13.

### Added
- Add the "installed" field to the media serializer. This is so that the
  frontend can detect media used that is no longer installed on the backend.

### Fixed
- Ensure the right notifications go to the right destinations when sending many
  of each.

### Changed
- Change the signature of the notification-plugin `send`-method to avoid
  passing in the database
- Send one email per email-address so as to not leak who else gets that email.

## [1.13.0] - 2023-09-19

Works with argus-frontend 1.11 and newer.

### Added
- Add inline destinations to user edit page in admin
- Add management command for listing filters
- Add management command for bulk acting on incidents matching a given filter

### Fixed
- Raise validation error on posting incident with tags without tag key

### Changed
- Drop support for Python 3.7
- Remove all remaining uses of `Filter.filter_string`, replace with
  Filter.filter, in preparation of removing the actual `filter_string` field
  from the database.

  The API v1 still accepts `filter_string` but it is optional. It will prefer
  the data in `filter`. v2 ignores the presence or absence of `filter_string`
  entirely.

## [1.12.4] - 2023-09-04

### Changed
- Ensure that the start event is created *after* the incident has its tags so
  that notification filters with tags trigger correctly.

## [1.12.3] - 2023-08-31

### Changed
- Change what is logged on notification sending in order to ease solving
  problems in production. Prior to this, we couldn't know whether there is
  a problem with matching an event to filters, or whether the problem is
  actually storing all incoming events. Turn on debug-logging to get it all.

## [1.12.2] - 2023-06-27

### Fixed
- When sending a notification in production a typo lead to an exception that
  prevented sending the notification but was otherwise hidden from the end
  user.

## [1.12.1] - 2023-05-05

### Fixed
- Fixed acking-bug that only occured if notifications were turned on

## [1.12.0] - 2023-05-03

### Added
- Add docs for how to write a notification plugin
- Add a new command "stresstest", for stress-testing the API
- Migration! Add a field "installed" to the Media-model
- Support running on Django 4.2
- Documented how to use email to send notifications to Slack
- Make the auth-method endpoint also show username/password

### Fixed
- Allow updating of a timeslot with an empty time recurrence list, which
  results in all time recurrences to be removed from the timeslot

### Changed
- Optimize and refactor bulk api operations
- Start the process of getting rid of `Filter.filter_string` by ensuring the
  info in `filter_string` is also in `Filter.filter`

## [1.11.1] - 2023-02-16

### Fixed
- CORS-headers do not want explicit port numbers if the ports are the default
  for their type, that is: 80 for http or 443 for https. This lead to CORS not
  working if there was an explicit port in the `ARGUS_FRONTEND_URL` setting,
  which used to generate a CORS entry for the frontend. Such port numbers are
  now stripped when generating the CORS header.

## [1.11.0] - 2023-02-02

With this version, the API for bulk changes of incidents and sending of
notifications to new and interesting destinations via destination plugins has
been frozen, and should be ready for use, completing what was started in 1.10.

## Added
- Also include frontend-url to incident in incident-serializer
- Show installed plugins in the metadata view

### Fixed
- Fix API for adding events in bulk, with tests
- Fix API for bulk acking, with tests

## [1.10.2] - 2022-12-13

### Changed
- Renamed the ticket creation endpoint via plugin from `/ticket/` to `/automatic-ticket/`

## [1.10.1] - 2022-12-08

### Changed

- Send serialized incidents to the ticket-plugin, not database objects
  (This makes plugins much easier to test.)

## [1.10.0] - 2022-11-17

### Added
- Added support for testing on Python 3.11 and Django 4.0, 4.1
- Plugin system for ticket system integrations, documented in the new "Ticket
  system settings" sections.
- Add a production-oriented Dockerfile and use Github to build and store images
- New API endpoint to create a new ticket in an external ticket system
- Add docs about notification plugins
- Added the possibility to filter notifications by event-type
- Added a management command that will create incidents if a source token is
  close to expiring
- Added an endpoint to create events for incidents in bulk
- Added an endpoint to set ticket_url of incidents in bulk
- Added the possibility to filter notifications by event-type

### Changed

- Flatten the json structure for posting acknowledgements.

## [1.9.0] - 2022-11-08

### Added

- Added an endpoint to acknowledge incidents in bulk
- Added an endpoint to get a refreshed auth token.
- Add a filter to find incidents with a duration longer than a given amount of
  minutes.
- Added tests for previously untested incident endpoints

## [1.8.1] - 2022-10-28

### Fixed
- Fix typo that prevented SMS messages from being sent.

## [1.8.0] - 2022-10-06

### Added
- A notification profile can now have a name.
- Added endpoint that returns True if another user has a destination with the
  same medium and settings as the destination with the given primary key

### Changed

- One timeslot can now be used by multiple notification profiles.

### Steps for upgrading

This update includes changes to the database model, requiring a migration of
the database.

## [1.7.0] - 2022-10-04

### Added

- Documentation for our own management commands (CLI-scripts)

### Steps for upgrading

Running migrate will complete the changes that started with 1.6.0.

## [1.6.0] - 2022-10-04

### Added
- New API endpoint `/incidents/all-events/` for listing all events.
- Users can now have multiple emails and phone numbers

### Steps for upgrading

This update includes changes to the database model, requiring a migration of
the database.

Which notification plugins are in use are now decided by the new setting
`MEDIA_PLUGINS`. There are no default contents of this setting, to make it
possible to turn off notifications.

In order to support the included email and sms-plugins, add the following to
your tailored settings-file:


```
MEDIA_PLUGINS = [
    "argus.notificationprofile.media.email.EmailNotification",
    "argus.notificationprofile.media.sms_as_email.SMSNotification",
]
```

## [1.5.1] - 2022-05-03

### Fixed
- Acking an incident when notifications were turned on was broken, this is
  a workaround.

## [1.5.0] - 2022-05-03

### Added
- New query parameter `search` for the incident endpoint. This allows searching
  for incidents that contain given keywords. The result is a list of incidents
  where each given keyword exists in the incident description and/or in any
  event descriptions that belongs to the incident.
- External authentication supported via REMOTE_USER environment variable.

### Changed
- All mentions of Uninett has been replaced with Sikt. This is because Uninett
  was a merged into Sikt – Norwegian Agency for Shared Services in Education
  and Research on January 1st 2022.

### Steps for upgrading

This update includes changes to the database model, requiring a migration of
the database.

Note that the migration that allows the text-search is quite heavy and may time
out if you have very many incidents. If this happens, make an issue of it
(including how many incidents and how long it took before timing out) and we'll
make a patch-release with a documented work around for you.

### Steps for testing

In order to run tox successfully on Python 3.10, make sure tox was installed
with Python 3.10 or testing might fail with:

```
KeyError: scripts
```

## [1.4.0] - 2022-04-28

### Added
- New API endpoint `/login-endpoints/` for listing all login endpoints.
- New query parameter `count` for the incident endpoint to be used along with
  a filter. This will make the endpoint return a count of how many incident
  matches the given filter along with the filter itself. This is useful for
  debugging.
- The `level` attribute for incidents can now be updated via the incident
  endpoint.

### Changed
- The initial event for stateless incidents will now be labeled as "Stateless"
  instead of "Incident start". Stateful incidents are still labeled "Incident
  start".

### Steps for upgrading

This update includes changes to the database model, requiring a migration of
the database.

## [1.3.6] - 2022-04-21

### Fixed
- NotificationProfileViewV1 should no longer appear in API v2.
