Several of our easily accessible users didn't like the frequent use of the
reddish color as an accent in the "argus" theme, they prefer reserving reddish
hues for extra important things. We've cut down on the accent-color everywhere:
in the incidents page we now use the primary color instead, everywhere else we
will fall back to the default for the tailwind/daisy class.
