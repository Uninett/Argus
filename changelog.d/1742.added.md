Made it possible to mark a filter as "public". This means that anyone can use
it in the incident list, for notification profiles or for making planned
maintenance tasks. The flag can currently only be set via the admin, and is
thus limited to administrators.

NOTES: The idea is to make it easy to have a little library of the most useful,
most used or just default filters, to make it faster to get started.
