Add new (unfinished) app: argus.htmx. Thiis is a new frontend written quite
old-style, with HTML enhanced with HTMx. This used to live in its own app
(PyPI: argus-htmx-frontend) and repo
(https://github.com/Uninett/argus-htmx-frontend/) and is in the process of
being completely merged with argus-server. All new issues and PR's should be
made towards the argus-server repo. Unfinished branches and issues should be
moved over here. PR's merged after the move will be moved by us.
