We are now using a task queue to send notifications instead of forking off
a process. This is to increase robustness and hopefully to increase throughput.
If argus is being used to send notifications, you MUST change your deployment
as there now is an additional service that needs to run in order to handle the
notifications on the queue. See the NOTES!


NOTES:

There is a new management command `db_worker` used to proceess the queue. In
order to send out notifications, this command needs to run supervised by
something. The included docker-compose for development already does this, but
if using for instance Kubernetes it should run in its own pod, and if running
on hardware it needs to be handled by for instance systemd, supervisor, nosh,
s6 or daemontools. See the new production section of the documentation.

If your argus sends no or very few notifications, it might be relevant to
override the settings file to use
`django_tasks.backends.immediate.ImmediateBackend`, see the site settings docs.
