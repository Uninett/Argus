Upgrade to Tailwind CSS v4 and DaisyUI v5.

NOTES:
- Custom themes defined in `DAISYUI_THEMES` must now use CSS variable syntax
  with explicit `--color-` prefixes (e.g., `"--color-primary": "#006d91"`).
- The `TAILWIND_THEME_OVERRIDE` setting has been removed. Use CSS `@theme`
  blocks in a `themes/override.css` file instead.

See the updated documentation for full details on theme customization.
