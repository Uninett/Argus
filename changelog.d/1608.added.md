Added support for a task queue. We're using `django-tasks`, which is in the
process of being merged into Django proper, with the backend `django-tasks-db`.
This stores the tasks in the same database as everything else. We're currently
only using the queue to send notifications, so if you are not using argus for
that (`SEND_NOTIFICATIONS` is off), nothing changes.
