# Files for tailwindcss

`styles.css` is automatically generated by the `tailwind_config` Django management command.
The source template is in `src/argus/htmx/templates/tailwind/styles.css`.

Tailwind v4 uses CSS-based configuration, so no separate JavaScript config file is needed.

The `snippets/` directory contains additional CSS snippets that are imported in `styles.css`.

The `themes/` directory contains custom DaisyUI v5 theme definitions.
