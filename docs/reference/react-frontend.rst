REACT Frontend
==============

The classic frontend is a single page application (SPA) written in REACT. See
the `Github repo of Argus-frontend <https://github.com/uninett/Argus-frontend>`_

It depends on `redis <https://redis.io/>`_, some additional 3rd party django
apps, needs its own specific settings and has a handful of API endpoints that
are not needed if running headless.

Dependencies
============

Install the python dependencies to talk to redis via ``pip install
argus-server[spa]``.

The docker-compose config included will run up a server for you during
development and testing. How to deploy redis in production will not be detailed
here.

Settings
========

Base the settings file on ``argus.spa.settings``.

The individual settings are in ``argus.spa.spa_settings``, but note:

* :setting:`ROOT_URLCONF` is set to ``argus.spa.root_urls``. If you prefer to
make your own root ``urls.py``, the frontend-specific urls can be imported from
``argus.spa.spa_urls``.
* :setting:`INSTALLED_APPS` is rewritten to add the apps ``channels`` and
``argus.spa``. The order matters,``channels`` must be early.

Domain settings
---------------

.. setting:: ARGUS_SPA_COOKIE_DOMAIN

* :setting:`ARGUS_SPA_COOKIE_DOMAIN` holds the domain of the Argus instance. This is the domain
  that the cookie is set for. It is needed to log into the frontend.

.. setting:: ARGUS_FRONTEND_URL

* :setting:`ARGUS_FRONTEND_URL` is used for redirecting back to frontend after logging in
  through Feide and CORS. Must either be a subdomain of or the same as
  :setting:`ARGUS_SPA_COOKIE_DOMAIN`.

In production, Argus requires the frontend and the backend to either be
deployed on the same domain, or the frontend to be on a subdomain of the
:setting:`ARGUS_SPA_COOKIE_DOMAIN`. When running Argus on localhost for
development and testing using the `dev`, `dockerdev` or `test_CI` settings-file
as a base, :setting:`ARGUS_SPA_COOKIE_DOMAIN` can be empty (and will default to
localhost).

Realtime updates
----------------

.. setting:: ARGUS_REDIS_SERVER

The Argus API can notify the frontend about changes in the list of open
incidents in realtime using a websocket (implemented using Django
Channels). The realtime interface requires access to a Redis server for message
passing.

By default, Argus will look for a Redis server on ``localhost:6379``. To use a
different server, set the :setting:`ARGUS_REDIS_SERVER` environment variable, e.g::

  ARGUS_REDIS_SERVER=my-redis-server.example.org:6379

.. setting:: CHANNEL_LAYERS

The realtime updates uses the app ``channels``. This setting by default depends
on :seting:`ARGUS_REDIS_SERVER`, itshould normally not be necessary to change
it.

CORS handling
-------------

For the react frontend to have permissions to talk to the backend in
production, CORS headers must be set correctly. See the documentation at
`django-cors-headers <https://pypi.org/project/django-cors-headers/>`_ for what
is possible.

Dataporten via OAuth2
---------------------

.. setting:: ARGUS_DATAPORTEN_KEY

* :setting:`ARGUS_DATAPORTEN_KEY` holds the id/key for using dataporten for authentication.

.. setting:: ARGUS_DATAPORTEN_SECRET

* :setting:`ARGUS_DATAPORTEN_SECRET` holds the dataporten password.

Refer to the section :ref:`dataporten <dataporten-reference>` for more information.

API Endpoints
=============

The following endpoints are only used by this frontend:

* ``/login-methods/``
* ``/api/v1/login/``
* ``/api/v2/login/``
* ``/api/v1/logout/``
* ``/api/v2/logout/``

Furthermore, visiting ``/oidc/login/dataporten_feide/`` when dataporten is set
up will trigger a login via dataporten.
