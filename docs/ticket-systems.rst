It is possible to automatically create a ticket from an Argus incident with
a pre-filled title and body.

Currently Argus supports an integration with Gitlab.

How to write a plugin for a desired ticket system is detailed in
:ref:`writing-ticket-system-plugins`.

To enable this feature information needs to be added to the
:ref:`site-specific-settings`. How to do that for each ticket system plugin is
detailed in :ref:`ticket-systems-settings`.
