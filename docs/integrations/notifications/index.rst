Notification plugins: sending notifications
===========================================

Notifications are sent with the help of a notification plugin to one or more
destinations.

A :index:`notification plugin` is a class that inherits from
``argus.notificationprofile.media.base.NotificationMedium``. It has a
``send(event, destinations, **kwargs)`` static method that does the actual
sending.

A :index:`destination` is a user-specific and plugin-specific instance of the
model DestinationConfig. In the DestinationConfig there's a field ``settings``
that has the necessary configuration for where to send the notification for
that type of plugin, like an email address, a phone number or a webhook.

A specific type of destination might also need extra settings in the Django
settings file, this is documented for each plugin.

Configuring which notification plugins to use
=============================================

In the :ref:`site-specific-settings` file the setting ``MEDIA_PLUGINS`` is
a list of enabled plugins.

The default is::

    MEDIA_PLUGINS = [
        "argus.notificationprofile.media.email.EmailNotification",
    ]

Notification plugins included on install
========================================

.. toctree::
   email-plugin
   sms-plugin

Other notification plugins
==========================

Open an issue to have a plugin added to this list. It needs to be publicly
accessible so we can check the code, and be on PyPI. We will link up both the
source code repo (or homepage otherwise) and the PyPI-entry.
