Settings for integration with ticket systems
============================================

The settings which are relevant for the integration with the different ticket
systems are ``TICKET_PLUGIN``, ``TICKET_ENDPOINT``,
``TICKET_AUTHENTICATION_SECRET`` and ``TICKET_INFORMATION``.

``TICKET_PLUGIN`` is the fully qualified name of the ticket plugin Python
class.

``TICKET_ENDPOINT`` is the link to the ticket system website the ticket should be
created at.

``TICKET_AUTHENTICATION_SECRET`` is a dictionary containing all the relevant
information that is needed to authenticate with the ticket system's API. It is
both possible to use token-based authentication as well as username- and
password-based authentication.

``TICKET_INFORMATION`` contains any additional information that is needed to
create a ticket, for example the specific repository or queue the ticket should
be created in and settings for custom fields.

To enable an integration with a ticket plugin these settings MUST be added
to Argus.
