Settings for integration with ticket systems
============================================

The settings which are relevant for the integration with the different ticket
systems are ``TICKET_PLUGIN``, ``TICKET_ENDPOINT``,
``TICKET_AUTHENTICATION_SECRET`` and ``TICKET_INFORMATION``.

``TICKET_PLUGIN`` is the fully qualified name of the ticket plugin Python
class. The included plugins are located in the ``argus.incident.ticket``
namespace, so the path should look something like this:
``argus.incident.ticket.FileName.PluginName``.

``TICKET_ENDPOINT`` is the link to the ticket system website the ticket should be
created at.

``TICKET_AUTHENTICATION_SECRET`` is a dictionary containing all the relevant
information that is needed to authenticate with the ticket system's API. It is
both possible to use token-based authentication as well as username- and
password-based authentication.

``TICKET_INFORMATION`` contains any additional information that is needed to
create a ticket, for example the specific repository or queue the ticket should
be created in.

To enable an integration with a ticket plugin these settings MUST be added
to Argus.

Request Tracker
---------------

* ``TICKET_PLUGIN``: ``"argus.incident.issue.request_tracker.RequestTrackerPlugin"``
* ``TICKET_ENDPOINT``: Link to self-hosted instance
* ``TICKET_AUTHENTICATION_SECRET``:
    - token-based authentication does not work with the library used, therefore username- and password-based authentication is necessary
    - ``{"username": username, "password": password}``
* ``TICKET_INFORMATION``:
    - the only additional information needed is the queue the ticket should be added to
    - ``{"queue": queue_name}``
