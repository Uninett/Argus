==================================
Howto: Write a good commit message
==================================

This repo strongly prefers a linear commit history. We squash, a lot.

Temporary commit messages
=========================

These will be squashed on merge, and start with a *lower case* letter.

If you fix a previous commit (fix a typo for instance) use ``git commit
--fixup`` to mark which commit is being improved. If the previous commit had
the message "Adjust frob to hinder overlap", use the following incantation::

    git commit --fixup ':/Adjust frob to hinder overlap'

The ":/" does a search in the commit log. It searches from most to least
recent so in the case above you might get away with ':/Adjust'.

Permanent commit messages
=========================

These will most likely be retained as-is in the commit history.

First line
----------

Start with an *upper case* letter in the first word.

The first line of the commit message should strive to be 50 characters or less.
It is always better to spend those characters on a good, short summary of what
the commit does. Avoid prefixes like "feat:", emojis, or adding issue
numbers/pull request numbers.

Complete the sentence "Merging this commit willâ€¦".

Examples:

* Fix typo
* Remove unused cruft
* Avoid triggering a race condition
* Fix off-by-one error
* Optimize database lookup
* Prevent a 500 server error on Feb 29
* Properly handle FooError on logout
* Split up test file
* Move Bar to separate file

Feel free to use a thesaurus to find a good verb.

If the "Fix typo" fixes a typo introduced in the same PR, please do a fixup,
see "Temporary commit messages" above.

Context and more info
---------------------

If there is more to add, have a blank line after the first line then describe
away. Issue numbers, pull request numbers, links to more info can all go here.

This is also the place for context, by that we mean *what is affected*. API,
frontend-only things, backend only things, subsystems like autocreating tickets
or sending notifications. This is especially important for new features.

Explanations as to what is actually going on or why a specific solution was chosen
when there are several available are especially welcome.

If this a pull request with a good and beefy explanation, copy the explanation
to the body of the commit so that the explanation stays with the code.

Commit messages cannot contain screenshots! If there is a visual change, try
describing it.

Collaborators
-------------

If you worked together with someone else on a commit, add them to the bottom
like this::

    ---------

    Co-authored-by: N N <nomen.nescio@example.org>

(Github might do this for you.)

How to squash commits
=====================

Squash early, squash often.

Github can help you squash *all* commits in a repo via squash on merge. If you
need more than one commit message, do an interactive rebase via the command
line.

Let the first line describe the set of commits as a whole. Then, after a blank
line, you may list the original messages, just remember to remove any "Fix
typo" (if it fixes a typo introduced earlier in this set of commits), "fixup",
"whoops", random letters knuckle-rolled in frustration and similar.

If the same message occurs more than once, keep only one. Remove it entirely
if it is a frustration-commit.

If one commit adds something and a later commit in the same set removes it,
please delete both messages.

After the first line and before the list of commits included you can add more
info just like with a non-squashed commit: links, issue numbers, explanations
etc.

If there are any "Co-authored-by"-blocks, collect them all at the bottom like
so::

    ---------

    Co-authored-by: Huey Duck <huey@duck.net>
    Co-authored-by: Dewey Duck <dewey@duck.net>
    Co-authored-by: Louie Duck <louie@duck.net>
    Co-authored-by: N N <nomen.nescio@example.org>
