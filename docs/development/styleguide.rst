Style guide for web frontend
============================

There's a live style guide on ``/styleguide/``. It contains a live form so that
you can experiment with form input to see what a valid and invalid form looks
like.

The live style guide is not complete, and not fully implemented into the site
yet. If you are looking for low hanging fruit:

* The headers (h1-h3) needs to be styled as per the style guide.
* The cards (all pages except the incident list and preferences page) should
  look the same.
* There should be no preferences directly in the user menu drop down.
* There should be no use of the class "border-b" anywhere.

More work is involved in making sure all form fields use the style guide
designs for inputs/labels. Another larger task is issue #1557:
`Restyling the preferences page <https://github.com/Uninett/Argus/issues/1557>_`.

See also issue #1519:
`Add styleguide <https://github.com/Uninett/Argus/issues/1519>_`.
