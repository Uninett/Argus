What is Argus?
--------------

Argus is an *alert aggregator* designed for storing and managing alerts
from different monitoring systems at one place. Argus is created for
**ease of alarm management** via a **personalized interface** and **customizable
alarm notifications**.

Log into Argus
--------------

Argus supports several login mechanisms:

* \ *username-password login* \
* \ *federated login with OAuth 2.0* \

Log in and start using Argus at **/accounts/login**.

2. Select the account you want to log in with.

3. Fill out *username* and *password* and press ``Log in``.

4. Continue with the preferred method for two-factor authentication.

Configure user settings
-----------------------

Add your own theme
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are three themes available out of the box in Argus: *Argus*, *Dark* and
*Light*. You can add your own theme by `overriding the default DAISYUI_THEMES
<https://argus-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/customization/htmx-frontend.html#themes-and-styling>`_. \
Talk to your system administrator if you want to add your own theme.
You can either select from the `available daisyUI themes
<https://daisyui.com/docs/themes/#list-of-themes>`_,
or create your own. For creating your own theme, we recommend using the
`daisyUI theme generator <https://v4.daisyui.com/theme-generator/>`_.

Choose what columns are shown in the incidents table
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is possible to `add or remove columns
<https://argus-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/customization/htmx-frontend.html#incident-table-column-customization>`_
in the *Incidents* table. Currently it is possible to
customize columns only globally for all users of the same installation of
Argus. Talk to your system administrator if you want to contribute to the
customization of the *Incidents* table columns.

Change date and time format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. `Open user menu`_.

2. Click on the *Date format* drop-down in the *User preferences* section.

    -  ``RFC`` - uses the RFC date format (Day, DD Mon YYYY HH:MM:SS GMT).
    -  ``EPOCH`` - uses the Unix epoch date format (seconds since
       1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC).

Work with alarms in Argus
-------------------------

**View**, **filter** and **update** alarms that come to Argus from
different sources (monitoring systems).

.. image:: img/incidents_page.png
  :width: 650

You can see all of your monitoring systems that are connected to Argus
in the *Sources* selector. Click on *Sources* in the *Filter incidents*
tab and all available monitoring systems will appear in the drop-down menu.

What is an incident in Argus
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An incident is an alarm that was sent to Argus from a monitoring system
of your choice.

Each incident has a *description* (created by the monitoring system),
*start time*, *duration*, *source* (which monitoring system it came
from), *tags* and *severity level*. An incident may have *end time*,
*ticket url* (associated ticket in an external ticket system). Incidents
may have different status. For example, an incident may be *open*, or
*closed* (resolved). An incident may also be *acknowledged* (noticed or
commented in any way), or not. In the detailed incident view below you
can get familiar with the above-mentioned attributes of an incident.
Note that an incident’s event feed is also available in the detailed
view. The event feed shows events like *closing* (resolving), and
*acknowledgment* of an incident.

.. image:: img/incident_details_view.png
  :width: 650

Each row in the *Incidents* table is one alarm. In the table you can see
an incident’s *start time*, *closed/open status*, whether an incident
has at least one *acknowledgement*, *severity level*, *source* (which
monitoring system the incident came from), *description* (created by the
monitoring system) and whether the incident has an associated *ticket
url* (label icon at the very end of the row).

Decide which incidents are shown in the table
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For ease of alarm management you can filter incidents so that only
incidents that match all preferred parameters are shown in the
*Incidents* table.

Apply the preferred filter by using the *Filter incidents* toolbar. Argus will
remember your filter settings from the last login session, and will use
those until you change them.

*Filter incidents* toolbar is available below the header in full-screen view:

.. image:: img/incidents_filter.png
  :width: 650

Filter by open/close status
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  If you only want *open* incidents to be displayed in the table, select
   ``Open`` in the *Open State* slider.

-  If you only want *closed* (resolved) incidents to be displayed in the
   table, select ``Closed`` in the *Open State* slider.

-  If you want both *open* and *closed* (resolved) incidents to be
   displayed in the table, select ``Both`` in the *Open State* slider.

Filter by acknowledgement status
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  If you only want *acknowledged* incidents to be displayed in the
   table, select ``Acked`` in the *Acked* slider.

-  If you only want **un**\ *\ acknowledged* incidents to be displayed
   in the table, select ``Unacked`` in the *Acked* slider.

-  If you want both *acknowledged* and *unacknowledged* incidents to be
   displayed in the table, select ``Both`` in the *Acked* slider.

   **specific monitoring system(s)**:

   1. Click on the *Sources* selector.

   2. In the drop-down that appears, you can see all available source
      systems. Click on the preferred one. The newly selected *source system*
      will appear in the input field.

   3. Repeat the process if you want to filter by several monitoring
      systems.

-  If you want the table to display incidents from **any monitoring
   system**, leave the *Sources* field empty.

   the *Tags* field empty.

.. _filter-by-severity-level:
Filter by severity level
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The severity level ranges from *1 - Critical* to *5 - Information*. If
you select *max severity level* to be **5**, all incidents will be
displayed in the table. If you select *max severity level* to be **2**,
only incidents with severity **1** and **2** will be displayed in the
table.

To change *max severity level*: select the preferred *max severity* option in
the *Level* slider.

What is a timeslot in Argus
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A timeslot is a collection of one or more recurrences with a meaningful
name. Saved timeslots can be used when `customizing alarm
notifications <#customize-alarm-notifications-in-argus>`_. Each
timeslot represents a window (or several windows) of time for when it is
OK to receive alarm notifications.

Note that every user has the default timeslot *All the time*:

.. image:: img/default_timeslot.png
  :width: 650

What is a recurrence in Argus
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Recurrences are building blocks for timeslots. Each recurrence
represents a time range on selected weekdays for when it is OK to
receive alarm notifications. A time range can either be:

* a whole day,
* or a window of time

Each recurrence has only one time range, and it applies to all days that
are selected in a given recurrence.

For example, in this timeslot with 3 recurrences, alarm notifications
are allowed from 4 p.m. to 8 a.m. on business days (note that it is not
possible to have a recurrence that goes from one day to the next), and
all hours on weekends:

2. Modify the ``Unsaved`` recurrence either in the *Create New Timeslot* box, or in one of
   your existing timeslots:

   .. image:: img/unsaved_recurrence.png
